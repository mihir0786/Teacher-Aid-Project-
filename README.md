# Teaching Aid 📚

**AI-Powered Classroom Analytics & Lecture Tracking Assistant**

Teaching Aid helps educators analyze their teaching habits, track student engagement, and monitor classroom performance through automated lecture transcription, AI-generated summaries, and comprehensive analytics. Built for teachers who need efficient classroom review with data-driven insights.

> **⚠️ Important:** This tool **assists** teachers—it does **not** replace professional judgment or comprehensive teaching evaluation. Every insight should be reviewed in context of your classroom environment. This is an analytical aid, not a replacement for teacher expertise.

## 🗺️ Architecture

### Data Flow

**Upload Pipeline:** Teacher uploads syllabus → AI extracts topics and generates roadmap → Topics stored with metadata. **Lecture Pipeline:** Audio recording uploaded → Speech-to-text transcription → Text chunked and analyzed → AI identifies topics covered, questions asked, examples used → Metrics computed and stored → Summary generated with key insights.

**Analytics Pipeline:** All lecture data aggregated → Progress calculated against syllabus roadmap → Engagement metrics computed → Trends identified → Dashboard displays visualizations and insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Analyzing the provided backend and frontend files, here is the comprehensive tech stack used for the **Professor Lecture Analytics** application.


### 💻 Frontend

The frontend uses **Vite** with **React 19** and supporting libraries for routing and data visualization.

- **Core Framework / Compiler:** Vite  
- **Library:** React 19 (`19.2.0`)  
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js (`^4.5.1`) via **react-chartjs-2** (`^5.3.0`)  
- **Routing:** react-router-dom (`^7.9.4`) for client-side navigation  
- **Tooling / Linting:** ESLint 9 with plugins for React Hooks and React Refresh  


### ⚙️ Backend

The backend is a Python API using modern tools for web development, database management, and AI processing.

- **Web Framework:** FastAPI (used in `main.py` for routing and dependency injection)  
- **Database / ORM:** SQLAlchemy (using `Session` and `text` for database interaction; SQLite as per `database.py`)  
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI Python Client  
- **File Parsing:** PyPDF2 (for `.pdf`) and python-docx (for `.docx`)  
- **Topic Modeling:** Gensim and NLTK (specifically for LDA and stop word processing)  
- **Environment Management:** python-dotenv  


### 🧠 AI Pipeline & Models

The application utilizes a multi-step AI pipeline combining proprietary LLMs and open-source NLP techniques.

- **Audio Transcription:** OpenAI Whisper (`model="whisper-large-v3"`)  
- **Syllabus Parsing:** LLaMA 3.1 70B Instruct (`llama-3.1-70b-instruct`)  
- **Lecture Analysis & Notes:** LLaMA 3.3 70B Instruct (`llama-3.3-70b-instruct`)  
- **Unsupervised Topic Extraction:** Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) via Gensim  

**Core AI Tasks:**

1. Audio-to-text conversion  
2. Structured content extraction (topics, questions, examples, key points)  
3. Syllabus comparison and coverage calculation (semantic topic matching is implied; currently, simple string comparison is implemented)  
4. Pedagogical note generation
